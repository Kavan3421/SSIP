# 🚗 RFID-Based Vehicle Gate Pass & Surveillance System

An advanced **RFID & QR Code-based vehicle surveillance and security system** using **Raspberry Pi**. This project automates vehicle entry and exit monitoring with **RFID authentication**, **QR code-based visitor pass**, and **real-time surveillance with image capture**.

---

## ✨ Features
- **RFID-Based Access Control** – Registered vehicles enter via RFID authentication.
- **QR Code Visitor Pass** – Generates & scans QR codes for visitor entry.
- **Automated Gate Control** – Servo motors operate barricades upon successful verification.
- **Real-Time Logging** – Stores entry/exit logs in MongoDB.
- **Camera Surveillance** – Captures and stores entry/exit images for security.
- **Admin & User Panel** – Separate interfaces for users and administrators.
- **Secure Authentication** – Validates users before allowing access.

---

## 🏗 System Workflow
1. **RFID Entry**: Vehicle scans RFID tag → Verified against the database → Gate opens → Entry logged → Camera captures image.
2. **RFID Exit**: Vehicle scans RFID tag again → Exit logged → Gate opens.
3. **QR Code Entry**: Visitor requests a pass → QR code is generated and stored → QR code is scanned at entry → Verified → Gate opens → Entry logged → Camera captures image.
4. **QR Code Exit**: QR code is scanned again → Verified → Exit logged → Gate opens.
